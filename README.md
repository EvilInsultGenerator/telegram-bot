# Evil Insult Generator PHP Telegram Bot

Evil Insult Generator's goal is to offer the most evil insults. Please help us to reach this honorable purpose by submitting insults
via mail.

### Tutorial

The button ```Generate Insult``` sends you a random insult in the language you selected with the ```Change Language``` button. Default is English. 

Clicking on ```Homepage``` gives you the link to our awesome [homepage](https://evilinsult.com/). 

The bot supports Telegram groups and [inline](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline) messages. 

*[@EvilInsultGeneratorBot](https://telegram.me/EvilInsultGeneratorBot)* without any additional info shows the menu where you can send a random insult or the link to the homepage.

If you add a language code (e.g. *[@EvilInsultGeneratorBot](https://telegram.me/EvilInsultGeneratorBot) la*) it shows you a preview in that language and you can click on it to submit it.

In case you write an unsupported language code (e.g. *[@EvilInsultGeneratorBot](https://telegram.me/EvilInsultGeneratorBot) xyz*) it sends one completely random insult. 

Questions and feedback are very welcome. Take care!

You can get help by sending **Help** to the bot.

### Installation

Insert your token you got from [@Botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather) into the `config.inc.php` and optionally your [Botan](https://botan.io/) token.
Upload all files to any webserver. We tested it with Apache and Nginx. But everyone else should be fine too.

Then you have to activate the webhook by visting [https://api.telegram.org/bot(BOT_TOKEN)/setWebhook?url=https://yoursite.com/index.php](https://api.telegram.org/bot(BOT_TOKEN)/setWebhook?url=https://yoursite.com/your_update.php)

Now the bot works. ðŸ‘Œ
